   <p class="intro">
    I'm a 20 year old graphic designer from Miami, Florida. When I was a kid, I wanted to be an architect , engineer, race car driver, or something with computers. Whenever I thought of which job I would like most however, I always thought of graphic design. I still like computers, and I've always liked designing stuff, so now I've tied them together. UI and UX design does that perfectly.
